<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, we employ PacketLab prototype endpoints to measure the availability of Internet critical services during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our main goals are <strong>(1) to test the PacketLab prototype endpoints and search for possible improvements to PacketLab</strong>, <strong>(2) to showcase the diverse functionality provided by PacketLab in real-world network measurements</strong>, and <strong>(3) obtain statistics regarding the availability of critical Internet services during the pandemic</strong>. Some measurements that we are currently planning of doing are measuring DNS query latencies from measurement endpoints, measuring latency from endpoints to the experiment controller, as well as measuring available bandwidth of endpoints. We hope that via the results of this project, we can further improve the existing PacketLab design and also obtain interesting statistics about the network condition during the COVID-19 pandemic along the way.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-packetlab">What is PacketLab?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2017/packetlab/packetlab.pdf"><strong>PacketLab</strong></a> is a universal measurement endpoint interface that lowers the barriers faced by experimenters and measurement endpoint operators. PacketLab is built on two key ideas: It moves the measurement logic out of the endpoint to a separate experiment control server, making each endpoint a lightweight packet source/sink. At the same time, it provides a way to delegate access to measurement endpoints while retaining fine-grained control over how endpoints are used by others, allowing research groups to share measurement infrastructure with little overhead. PacketLab is currently still under development. However, a prototype reference endpoint implementation as a stand-alone binary (packaged in a Docker image) is available to run network measurement experiments utilizing TCP and UDP services, which we will employ to perform network measurements in this project.</p>
<h2 id="why-packetlab-why-even-do-this">Why PacketLab? Why even do this?</h2>
<p>Contrary to utilizing existing measurement infrastructure, in this project, we opt to employ PacketLab due to the general functionality provided where a much larger variety of different experiments can be executed without needing to change the measurement endpoint in any way. With this project, we hope to showcase the diverse ability of PacketLab as well as put the existing prototype of PacketLab to test and identify some possible improvements for the PacketLab design.</p>
<p>In addition, as we go through the COVID-19 pandemic with social distancing being practiced, Internet usage is expected to rise with additional multimedia traffic introduced due to the utilization of video conferencing software and multimedia entertainment services. It would therefore be interesting to perform network measurements to see the actual impact of the pandemic on Internet performance, especially in terms of availability of critical network services.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-we-do-with-the-deployed-endpoints">What will we do with the deployed endpoints?</h2>
<p>For the deployed endpoints, we currently plan to perform Internet measurement experiments such as measuring latency for queries to public DNS resolvers (e.g. Google public DNS) and local DNS resolvers, measurement of network latency from endpoints to the experiment controller at UIUC, as well as measurement of the available bandwidth of each endpoint.</p>
<p>As the PacketLab reference endpoint implementation is currently still under development, it may be possible that we will distribute updated endpoint binaries to deployed endpoint Docker containers for bug fix and feature enhancement. The process of updating will be done securely with digital signatures employed to prevent tampering with the sent binary.</p>
<p>Due to this project being temporary during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, a kill switch mechanism is embedded in the endpoint where when signaled, the execution of the endpoint will be stopped and the Docker container will exit afterward. The kill switch will be turned on after the measurement experiments have all been completed.</p>
<p>In addition, the execution of the endpoint will also be halted if the endpoint failed to reach the pktlab.caida.org:20557 HTTP server for 3 consecutive days to prevent the existence of lingering measurement endpoints that do not have Internet connectivity.</p>

<h3 id="retrieve-and-load-the-docker-image">Retrieve and load the Docker image?</h3>
<p>Currently, the PacketLab endpoint is packaged as a Docker image. To retrieve and load the Docker image, follow the following 2 steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step (1): Download the Docker image <a href="http://pktlab.caida.org:20557/pktlabme_image.tar.gz">pktlabme_image.tar.gz</a>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Optional: The digital signature for the image is available <a href="http://pktlab.caida.org:20557/pktlabme_image.tar.gz.sha256">here</a>. To verify the image, one could download the <a href="/COVID-19/public.pem">ECDSA public key</a> and verify the image tarball via the following OpenSSL command (tested with OpenSSL 1.1.1):</p>
<pre><code>openssl dgst -sha256 -verify public.pem -signature pktlabme_image.tar.gz.sha256 pktlabme_image.tar.gz
</code></pre><p>The command will print <code>Verified OK</code> if the image and signature match.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Step (2): Load the downloaded PacketLab Docker image via running:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>docker load -i pktlabme_image.tar.gz
</code></pre><p>The Docker image is now loaded and ready to go.</p>
<h3 id="run-the-packetlab-measurement-endpoint-after-loading-the-docker-image">Run the PacketLab measurement endpoint after loading the Docker image?</h3>
<p>To instantiate a container from the Docker image and run it, execute the following command:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -d --rm pktlabme
</code></pre><p>The container ID for the instantiated endpoint Docker container will be printed if started successfully. At this point, the endpoint is now up and available for experiment running.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that running the container in detached mode (<code>-d</code> option) is highly recommended due to problems of detaching from the container. The <code>--rm</code> option allows automatic removal of the instantiated container after the container stops.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="stop-running-the-endpoint">Stop running the endpoint?</h3>
<p>If one would like to stop running the endpoint, first find the container ID printed when running the container, or run</p>
<pre><code>docker ps
</code></pre><p>and identify the container ID corresponding to the <code>pktlabme</code> image.
After having the container ID, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>docker stop [container ID]
</code></pre><p>to stop the container.</p>
<h3 id="remove-the-instantiated-docker-container">Remove the instantiated Docker container?</h3>
<p>After stopping the endpoint container, to clean up the instantiated container one will need to remove it.
If the <code>--rm</code> option is specified when running the Docker container, there is no need to explicitly remove the stopped container as it is done automatically. Otherwise, to remove the container run</p>
<pre><code>docker rm [container ID]
</code></pre><p>with the <code>container ID</code> being the same as that used to stop the container.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that if somehow one cannot recall the container ID, one can run the command</p>
<pre><code>docker ps -a
</code></pre><p>and look for exited PacketLab containers corresponding to the <code>pktlabme</code> image. (note the <code>-a</code> option since <code>docker ps</code> defaults to only showing running containers)</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="remove-the-loaded-docker-image">Remove the loaded Docker image?</h3>
<p>To delete the loaded endpoint Docker image, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>docker rmi pktlabme
</code></pre>

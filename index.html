<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, we employ PacketLab prototype endpoints to measure the availability of Internet critical services during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic. Our main goals are <strong>(1) to test the PacketLab prototype endpoints and search for possible improvements to PacketLab</strong>, <strong>(2) to showcase the diverse functionality provided by PacketLab in real-world network measurements</strong>, and <strong>(3) obtain statistics regarding the availability of critical Internet services during the pandemic</strong>. Some measurements that we are currently planning of doing are measuring DNS query latencies from measurement endpoints, measuring latency from endpoints to the experiment controller, as well as measuring available bandwidth of endpoints. We hope that via the results of this project, we can further improve the existing PacketLab design and also obtain more information on the variation of network resource consumption during this time.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-packetlab">What is PacketLab?</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.caida.org/publications/papers/2017/packetlab/packetlab.pdf"><strong>PacketLab</strong></a> is a universal measurement endpoint interface that lowers the barriers faced by experimenters and measurement endpoint operators. PacketLab is built on two key ideas: It moves the measurement logic out of the endpoint to a separate experiment control server, making each endpoint a lightweight packet source/sink. At the same time, it provides a way to delegate access to measurement endpoints while retaining fine-grained control over how endpoints are used by others, allowing research groups to share measurement infrastructure with little overhead. PacketLab is currently still under development. However, a prototype reference endpoint implementation as a stand-alone binary (packaged in a Docker image) is available to run network measurement experiments utilizing TCP and UDP services, which we will employ to perform network measurements in this project.</p>
<h2 id="why-packetlab-why-even-do-this">Why PacketLab? Why even do this?</h2>
<p>Contrary to utilizing existing measurement infrastructure, in this project, we opt to employ PacketLab due to the general functionality provided where a much larger variety of different experiments can be executed without needing to change the measurement endpoint in any way. With this project, we hope to showcase the diverse ability of PacketLab as well as put the existing prototype of PacketLab to test and identify some possible improvements for the PacketLab design.</p>
<p>In addition, as we go through the COVID-19 pandemic with social distancing being practiced, Internet usage is expected to rise with additional multimedia traffic introduced due to the utilization of video conferencing software and multimedia entertainment services. It would therefore be interesting to perform network measurements to see the actual impact of the pandemic on Internet performance, especially in terms of availability of critical network services.</p>
<h2 id="what-will-we-do-with-the-deployed-endpoints">What will we do with the deployed endpoints?</h2>
<p>For the deployed endpoints, we currently plan to perform Internet measurement experiments such as measuring latency for queries to public DNS resolvers (e.g. Google public DNS) and local DNS resolvers, measurement of network latency from endpoints to the experiment controller at UIUC, as well as measurement of the available bandwidth of each endpoint.</p>
<p>As the PacketLab reference endpoint implementation is currently still under development, it may be possible that we will distribute updated endpoint binaries to deployed endpoint Docker containers for bug fix and feature enhancement. The process of updating will be done securely with digital signatures employed to prevent tampering with the sent binary.</p>
<p>Due to this project being temporary during the period of the COVID-19 pandemic, a kill switch mechanism is embedded in the endpoint where when signaled, the execution of the endpoint will be stopped and the Docker container will exit afterward. The kill switch will be turned on after the measurement experiments have all been completed.</p>
<p>In addition, the execution of the endpoint will also be halted if the endpoint failed to reach the pktlab.caida.org:20557 HTTP server for 3 consecutive days to prevent the existence of lingering measurement endpoints that do not have Internet connectivity.</p>

<h3 id="retrieve-and-load-the-docker-image">Retrieve and load the Docker image?</h3>
<p>Currently, the PacketLab endpoint is packaged as a Docker image. To retrieve and load the Docker image, follow the following 2 steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>Step (1): Download the Docker image <a href="http://pktlab.caida.org:20557/pktlabme_image.tar.gz">pktlabme_image.tar.gz</a>.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Optional: The digital signature for the image is available <a href="http://pktlab.caida.org:20557/pktlabme_image.tar.gz.sha256">here</a>. To verify the image, one could download the <a href="https://packetlab.github.io/First-Shot/public.pem">ECDSA public key</a> and verify the image tarball via the following OpenSSL command (tested with OpenSSL 1.1.1):</p>
<pre><code>openssl dgst -sha256 -verify public.pem -signature pktlabme_image.tar.gz.sha256 pktlabme_image.tar.gz
</code></pre><p>The command will print <code>Verified OK</code> if the image and signature match.</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Step (2): Load the downloaded PacketLab Docker image via running the following command in the terminal:</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>docker load -i pktlabme_image.tar.gz
</code></pre><p>The Docker image is now loaded and ready to go.</p>
<h3 id="run-the-packetlab-measurement-endpoint-after-loading-the-docker-image">Run the PacketLab measurement endpoint after loading the Docker image?</h3>
<p>To instantiate a container from the Docker image and run it, execute the following command in the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>docker run -t -i pktlabme
</code></pre><p>The terminal will then start printing some information regarding execution. At this point, the endpoint is now up and available for experiment running. Please take note of the <code>Endpoint ID</code> information (a base10 integer) printed out by the endpoint, since this information can be used to retrieve additional information regarding experiments run on the corresponding endpoint.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that running the container with <code>-t</code> (allocate a pseudo-TTY) and <code>-i</code> (interactive mode) options is highly recommended to allow for detaching and reattaching to the container.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="detaching">Detaching</h4>
<p>After running the container with the <code>-i</code> and <code>-t</code> options, to detach from the container, type in <code>Ctrl-p</code> + <code>Ctrl-q</code> in the container terminal.</p>
<h4 id="reattaching">Reattaching</h4>
<p>To reattach to the endpoint container after detaching, run</p>
<pre><code>docker attach [container ID]
</code></pre><p>where <code>container ID</code> is the ID of the endpoint container.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Note that the <code>container ID</code>, which is for Docker container management, is different from the endpoint ID given by the endpoint. To find the container ID, first detach from the container, then run</p>
<pre><code>docker ps -a
</code></pre><p>in the terminal, and identify the container having the image name <code>pktlabme</code> to find the corresponding container ID. One can detach from the container again using the <code>Ctrl-p</code> + <code>Ctrl-q</code> keystrokes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h4 id="endpoint-id">Endpoint ID</h4>
<p>In addition to retrieving the endpoint ID when running the container, one can also reattach to the container via the terminal and obtain the endpoint ID, which is printed periodically by the endpoint. In addition, for those running the endpoint with Docker Desktop, the endpoint ID is also available by accessing the Docker Desktop dashboard and the Logs for the endpoint container.</p>
<h3 id="stop-running-the-endpoint">Stop running the endpoint?</h3>
<p>If one would like to stop running the endpoint, first find the container ID by running</p>
<pre><code>docker ps -a
</code></pre><p>and identify the container ID corresponding to the <code>pktlabme</code> image.
After having the container ID, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>docker stop [container ID]
</code></pre><p>to stop the container.</p>
<h3 id="remove-the-instantiated-docker-container">Remove the instantiated Docker container?</h3>
<p>After stopping the endpoint container, to clean up the instantiated container one will need to remove it. To remove the container run</p>
<pre><code>docker rm [container ID]
</code></pre><p>with the <code>container ID</code> being the same as that used to stop the container.</p>
<h3 id="remove-the-loaded-docker-image">Remove the loaded Docker image?</h3>
<p>To delete the loaded endpoint Docker image, run the following command:</p>
<pre><code>docker rmi pktlabme
</code></pre>
